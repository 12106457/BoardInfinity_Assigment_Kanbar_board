# Kanban Board

## Overview
  
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage tasks and workflow efficiently by organizing tasks into columns representing different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Complete). It helps teams visualize work, track progress, and limit work in progress (WIP) to improve productivity.

## Key Features of a Kanban Board

- **Visual Workflow**: Tasks are represented as cards and move through columns that represent stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits**: Restricts the number of tasks in each stage to prevent overloading and ensure focus.
- **Continuous Flow**: Tasks can be added or moved at any time, allowing for a flexible and dynamic workflow.
- **Task Details**: Each task (card) can include descriptions, assignees, deadlines, attachments, and comments for better management.
- **Swimlanes**: Horizontal rows that categorize tasks by priority, team, or type for better organization.
- **Metrics and Analytics**: Provides insights into task progress, bottlenecks, and efficiency through metrics like cycle time and lead time.
